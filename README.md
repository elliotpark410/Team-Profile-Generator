The Team Profile Generator is a command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an index.html webpage that displays summaries for each person. The index.html is dynamically generated with user input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). Test-driven development done with [Jest package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest). The purpose of this application is so that developers can quickly create an engineering team summary for new projects.

>npm install -g npm

<br>

3. After installing npm, you have to initialize npm. In command line, you can enter:

>npm init -y

<br>

4. Now you have to install Inquirer.js which is one of the many node packages. In command line, you can enter:

>npm install inquirer

<br>

5. Additionally, if you would like to run tests, you have to install Jest.js which is one of the many node packages. In command line, you can enter:

>npm install jest

<br>


<!-- ## Prerequisites
Requires node.js, npm inquirer, and npm jest (optional)

<br> -->


## Test-Instructions

```bash
npm run test 
```

<br>

## Code-Snippets

This code snippet shows how you can create an HTML content using jQuery and CSS Bootstrap

* jQuery allows user to dynamically generate HTML code within JavaScript with $(`EnterHTMLContentHere`);

* Bootstrap CSS has pre-built cards with CSS styling that you can grab from their website


```

var fiveDayForecastCard = $(`
    <div class="pl-3">
        <div class="card pl-3 pt-3 mb-3 bg-primary text-light" style="width: 12rem;>
            <div class="card-body">
                <h5>${dateFiveDayForecast}</h5>
                <p>${iconURLFiveDayForecast}</p>
                <p>Temperature: ${cityWeatherFiveDayForecast.temperature} Â°F</p>
                <p>Humidity: ${cityWeatherFiveDayForecast.humidity}\%</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    <div>
`);

$("#five-day-forecast").append(fiveDayForecastCard);

```
