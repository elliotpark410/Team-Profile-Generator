## Code Snippets

This code snippet shows how you can create an HTML content using jQuery and CSS Bootstrap

* jQuery allows user to dynamically generate HTML code within JavaScript with $(`EnterHTMLContentHere`);

* Bootstrap CSS has pre-built cards with CSS styling that you can grab from their website


```

var fiveDayForecastCard = $(`
    <div class="pl-3">
        <div class="card pl-3 pt-3 mb-3 bg-primary text-light" style="width: 12rem;>
            <div class="card-body">
                <h5>${dateFiveDayForecast}</h5>
                <p>${iconURLFiveDayForecast}</p>
                <p>Temperature: ${cityWeatherFiveDayForecast.temperature} Â°F</p>
                <p>Humidity: ${cityWeatherFiveDayForecast.humidity}\%</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    <div>
`);

$("#five-day-forecast").append(fiveDayForecastCard);
