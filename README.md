[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


The Team Profile Generator is a command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an index.html webpage that displays summaries for each person. The index.html is dynamically generated with user input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). Test-driven development is done with [Jest package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest). The purpose of this application is so that developers can quickly create an engineering team summary for new projects.

## Getting-Started

To begin the application, use the following in command line:

```bash
node index.js
```
<br>


## Installation

1. You will need to install Node.js. Here is a link below:

>https://nodejs.org/en/download/

<br>

2. Once you have downloaded Node.js, you will want to download node package manager (npm). In command line, you can enter:

>npm install -g npm

<br>

3. After installing npm, you have to initialize npm. In command line, you can enter:

>npm init -y

<br>

4. Now you have to install Inquirer.js which is one of the many node packages. In command line, you can enter:

>npm install inquirer

<br>

5. Additionally, if you would like to run tests, you have to install Jest.js which is one of the many node packages. In command line, you can enter:

>npm install jest

<br>


<!-- ## Prerequisites
Requires node.js, npm inquirer, and npm jest (optional)

<br> -->


## Test-Instructions

To test with jest (optional), use the following in command line:
```bash
npm run test 
```

<br>

## Code-Snippets

This code snippet shows how you can create dynamically generated HTML file using node.js

* function writeToFile(employeeData) utilizes a node module called "fs", i.e. file system, which allows us to access physical file systems. "fs.writeFile()" method is used to asynchonously write specified data to a file

* function writeToFile(employeeData) creates a file "./dist/index.html" and writes data "employeeData which is dynamically generated HTML using generateHTML.js and teamArray"

* If there is an error during the file writing process, then it will console the error. If there is no error, then it will console "Your team profile has been created"

```

function generateCard(teamArray) {
  writeToFile(generateHTML(teamArray));
}

function writeToFile(employeeData) {
  fs.writeFile("./dist/index.html", employeeData, (err) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
      return;
    } else {
      console.log("Your team profile has been created");
    }
  });
}

```

## Learning-Points

* How to do test-driven development with npm Jest.js

* How to create command line prompts with npm Inquirer.js

* How to create files of dynamically generated HTML content with fs.writeFile() method

* How to create a new instance of an object using Object Oriented Programming e.g. 
```
const John = new Student('John', 'Appleseed', '30');
```
